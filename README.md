# Neufi NFT Wars Challange

  Firstly, I started with writing the contract. But before that, I had questions about ERC1155. So I googled it and made some research before coding. And I needed to choose which testing environment I use. I started with hardhat and typescript. 
  I made a pseudo-schema before writing the code

I created metadata for 3 of them with images for example. I chose dwarves from Lord Of The Rings.

After finishing the contract I started to write tests. Actually, the tests were tiring and took too long in comparison with the contract.

Try running these commands:

```shell
